# 📊 Sales Forecasting Optimisation

This project focuses on **optimising sales forecasts** using both **statistical** and **deep learning** models.  
Built in **Google Colab**, the notebook demonstrates methods such as **ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM** to capture demand patterns and improve forecasting accuracy.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on sales data.  
- Preprocess time series data for modelling.  
- Build and compare forecasting models: **ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM**.  
- Optimise forecasts using feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.  
- Visualise predictions and evaluate accuracy with RMSE, MAPE, and MAE.

# 📈 Results

ARIMA worked well for short-term trends.


Prophet handled seasonality effectively.

LSTM captured complex sequential dependencies.
