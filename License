# Project Description: Sales Forecasting Optimisation

This project demonstrates how to apply **time series forecasting** methods to optimise sales predictions. Using real-world datasets, we explore both **traditional statistical models** (ARIMA, Prophet) and **deep learning** methods (LSTM) for demand forecasting.  

The notebook covers:  
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis  
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning  
- Visualising forecasts  
- Evaluating models with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE  

**Goal**: Provide a reproducible workflow to help businesses improve demand planning, inventory management, and decision-making.
